# Dashboard Layout

The dashboard presents all real-time sensor data in a clean, student-friendly format. Each card updates continuously as the wind tunnel operates.

## 🟦 Lift & Drag Card

Shows the aerodynamic forces measured by the balance system.

- Lift (positive upward)
- Drag (positive downstream)
- Toggle between **Wall** and **Floor** configurations depending on your balance orientation.

Useful for:
- Airfoil lift curve experiments  
- Drag vs. Reynolds number labs  
- Comparing student-built models

---

## 🟥 Pressure Card

Displays real-time pitot and static pressure readings.

Includes:
- **Dynamic pressure (q)**
- **Static pressure (Ps)**

Useful for:
- Determining airspeed  
- Pitot calibration labs  
- Bernoulli demonstrations

## 📐 Angle of Attack (AOA) Card

Reads the current AOA measured by the mechanical encoder.

- Resolution: Typically 0.1° (device-specific)
- Range: ±45° depending on mounting

Used in:
- Lift curve slope experiments  
- Stall angle determination  
- 2D vs. 3D wing comparison labs
