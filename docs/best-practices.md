# Best Practices for Lab Use

To help instructors and students get reliable, repeatable results, follow these recommended procedures.

---

## ⚖️ Always Zero Before Each Test

Even small mounting differences create offsets.  
Zero scales:
- After installing a model  
- After adjusting AOA  
- Before every experiment run

---

## 🌡 Allow Readings to Stabilise

Students should wait 3–5 seconds after:
- Changing fan speed  
- Adjusting AOA  
- Zeroing the system  

This ensures stable data.

---

## 📊 Record Short, Clear Sweeps

For educational labs:
- Sweep AOA in small increments (1–2°)
- Let readings stabilise at each step
- Use steady wind speeds for direct comparison

---

## 💾 Save CSV Files Immediately

Each student group should download their CSV **before starting a new test**.  
New recordings overwrite the previous dataset.

---

## 🔌 Ensure Stable Power

Avoid:
- USB power banks  
- Under-powered adapters  
- Loose barrel jack connections

Stable power = stable sensors.

---

## 🧪 Keep Models Simple

Especially in first-year labs:
- Avoid highly flexible wings  
- Keep surfaces clean  
- Check alignment carefully

Clear results help students understand the physics.
