## 🧭 First-Time Overview

When the web app loads, you will see four major information cards:

- **Lift & Drag**
- **Pressure**
- **Angle of Attack**
- **Wind Speed**

Below these are the primary controls for recording and exporting data.

If you are running a lab class, students can connect simultaneously (5–10 devices recommended).

## 🛠 Before Running Your First Test

1. Ensure the model is mounted securely.
2. Set AOA to 0° unless a specific starting angle is required.
3. With fans off, click **Zero Scales** to tare all sensors.
4. Confirm readings are stable (lift/drag ~0, pressure ~0).

You’re ready to begin.
