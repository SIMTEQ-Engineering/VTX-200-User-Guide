# Troubleshooting

Common issues encountered in educational labs and how to solve them.

---

## ❌ Web App Not Loading

Try:
- Ensure you're connected to **WindTunnel_AP**
- Refresh the page
- Try another device (some school networks block AP-mode routing)
- Restart the controller

---

## ❌ No Live Data Showing

Possible causes:
- Loose sensor wires  
- Load cell amplifier cables unplugged  
- Pressure sensor tubing misaligned  
- Model obstructing pitot tube  

Fix:
1. Turn off fans  
2. Click **Zero Scales**  
3. Confirm pressures read ~0  
4. Check pitot tube alignment

## ❌ AOA Not Changing

Check:
- Mechanical linkage  
- Encoder cable  
- Debris blocking rotation  
- Model hitting tunnel walls at high AOA

---

## ❌ Wind Speed Stuck or Unstable

Often caused by:
- Pitot tube not pointing upstream  
- Tubing blocked  
- Fan speed too low (below ~5 m/s)

Suggestion:
- Gently straighten pitot tube  
- Increase fan power slightly

## ❌ Lift/Drag Fluctuating Severely

This may happen due to:
- Turbulence at high AOA  
- Students bumping the model  
- Loose mounting screws  
- Vibrations from fan/bench

Check stability before recording data.
