# Interpreting Data

This guide helps students understand what each measurement means and how to use it in experiments.

## 🟦 Lift & Drag

Measured by the strain-gauge balance.

Units:
- Grams (g) or Newtons (N), depending on configuration

Students typically convert readings into:

- Coefficient of Lift (CL)
- Coefficient of Drag (CD)

Using:

CL = L / (0.5 * ρ * V² * S)
CD = D / (0.5 * ρ * V² * S)

Where:
- L = lift  
- D = drag  
- ρ = air density  
- V = wind speed  
- S = wing planform area

## 📐 Angle of Attack (AOA)

Reported in degrees (°).

Used for:
- Lift curve slope experiments  
- Determining stall angle  
- Understanding flow separation  

Most educational tests sweep from −5° → +20°.

## 🟥 Pressure

Shows:
- Pitot dynamic pressure
- Static pressure

Students can use dynamic pressure (q) for:

- Airspeed calculations  
- Bernoulli demonstrations  
- Pressure distribution experiments (if extended hardware available)

---

## 💨 Wind Speed

Calculated using dynamic pressure.

Important teaching notes:
- Wind speed increases nonlinearly with fan power  
- Students can observe turbulence spikes at high AOAs  
- Speed is sensitive to pitot alignment
